## Talker-Reasoner

### [Shiyu Fang](https://fangshiyuu.github.io/)

This project is still under development, and we present some experimental results here. In the system, human drivers can express their intentions through voice, which are then processed by a fast-slow system built with an LLM and an external database (referred to as the Talker-Reasoner). This system outputs CAV behavior (at 10 Hz) and eHMI information accordingly.
